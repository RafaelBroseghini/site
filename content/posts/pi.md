# Introduction

> You can find all of the manifests for my k8s setup at my [homelab](https://github.com/rafaelbroseghini/homelab) GitHub repository.

Over the past few weeks I have been playing around with my RaspberryPi 5 to host a `k3s` cluster, a Certificate Authority, some microservices and to learn physical computing.

It's been going pretty well, but I wanted to minimize the amount of manual intervention needed from me to deploy and debug services running in my `k3s` cluster. Since I have had experience with ArgoCD, I knew it was a good tool for the job!

The ultimate goal is to get the cluster up and running on my Raspberry Pi and be able to **securely** access it not only from my home network but also **anywhere in the world** (thanks to [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)! - more on it on another post).

## K3s

My Raspberry Pi kubernetes cluster runs on a k3s distribution, which is packaged as a single <70MB binary. Perfect for my use case!

[Following the docs](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start#install-script), to get a `k3s` cluster up and running on my 1 node RaspberryPi cluster all I need to do is run:

Add `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory` to the end of `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`

```bash
sudo reboot
```

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

## ArgoCD

`Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.` It's an amazing project with a large active community! I encourage [you to head over to the docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to learn more if you're interested!

### How I bootstrap ArgoCD

I personally pick the version of ArgoCD I want to deploy on my cluster and run:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/<VERSION>/manifests/install.yaml
```

This installs a non-HA version of Argo, which is ok for my homelab setup.

Once I get Argo running in the cluster and the pods come up and healthy, I log into the UI with the initial admin login and make sure it's properly responding:

```bash
argocd login --core
argocd admin initial-password # copy the password
argocd admin dashboard # username: admin / password copied from above
```

### Managing Applications

In short, ArgoCD reacts to changes in version control systems and applies changes to Kubernetes objects in cluster(s). 

There are a variety of ways that you can structure repositories to manage applications. For the purpose of this guide we will have of repository called `homelab` that will both host the ArgoCD applications and the configuration of those apps. 

I encourage you to read [this post](https://codefresh.io/blog/how-to-structure-your-argo-cd-repositories-using-application-sets/) by Kostis Kapelonis on different ways to structure your Git repos.

#### App-of-Apps Pattern

In order for us to **avoid** having to `kubectl apply -f` each application individually, we will leverage the [app-of-apps](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern) pattern through a `root` application. One of the main goals was to manually intervene as little as possible!

The application YAML will point to the `k8s/apps` folder which will apply all applications in the cluster for us auto magically.

##### Root Application

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
  name: root
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: argocd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: k8s/apps
    repoURL: https://github.com/rafaelbroseghini/homelab.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

We need to manually bootstrap the root application once and only once:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/root.yaml
```

##### Managing Applications

Now that our root app is applied, it will start to apply its child resources immediatelly. Below is the `argocd` application that will get applied. That's the power of ArgoCD! ArgoCD managing ArgoCD itself.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
  name: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: argocd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: k8s/config/argocd/base
    repoURL: https://github.com/rafaelbroseghini/homelab.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

I hope you can see how this process would repeat for any application(s) that you wish to deploy in your cluster. 

We would add the `Application` yaml under the correct path in the `apps` folder and the `root` application will take care of [auto syncing](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/) it for us!

Now head over to the ArgoCD UI `/argocd` path, and hard refresh your `root` application. You should see the `argocd` application show up and auto sync.

Using the structure at [homelab/k8s](https://github.com/rafaelbroseghini/homelab/k8s) allows me to manage a lightweight k3s cluster in my Raspberry Pi 5 with almost no manual intervention needed! 

Feel free to clone the repo and play with it! :)
