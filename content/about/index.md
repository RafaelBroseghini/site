Hello! My name is Rafael Broseghini! I am a Platform Engineer at Trimble, Inc.

My current professional focus is designing and building workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering teams, leveraging the cloud-native ecosystem. I specialize in solutions that accelerate deployment cycles by abstracting operational complexity while ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.

I am a huge [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football) fan and travel enthusiast. I enjoy biking, reading, cliff jumping, skydiving and have recently started to get into home automation.
