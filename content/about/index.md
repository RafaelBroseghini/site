Hello! My name is Rafael Broseghini! I am a Platform Engineer at Trimble, Inc.

My current professional focus is designing, building and supporting an internal developer platform that streamlines end-users' software lifecycle. I specialize in solutions that accelerates deployment cycles by abstracting operational complexity while ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.

I am a huge [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football) fan and travel enthusiast. I enjoy biking, reading and have recently started to get into home automation.
