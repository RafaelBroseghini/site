I am a Platform Engineer at Trimble,Inc working with Azure, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Python, Go, etc.

I specialize in building developer platforms that accelerate software delivery by abstracting infrastructure and operational complexities. My current focus is designing and implementing a self-service platform that reduces deployment time from days/hours to minutes while maintaining security and compliance standards.

With deep experience in Software Development, Infrastructure as Code, and GitOps practices, I efficiently bridge the gap between development and operations through automation and platform engineering best practices.
