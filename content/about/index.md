I am a Platform Engineer at [Trimble,Inc](https://www.trimble.com/en) specializing in cloud-native technologies including Azure, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Go, and Python.

My focus is architecting, building and maintaining internal developer platforms that streamline the software delivery lifecycle. I specialize in self-service solutions that reduce deployment cycles by abstracting operational complexity while ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance standards.

I am a huge [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football) fan and travel enthusiast. I enjoy biking, reading and have recently started to get into home automation.
